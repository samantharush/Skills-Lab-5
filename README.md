# Skills-Lab-5

## What is this thing?
This is a CMPINF0010 Group lab project that was initially due March 4, 2021 and had to receive updated documentation for the following week.

## What does this thing do?
This program takes a name (or any text entry) entered from its user, then prints it out as it was entered before printing it out again in all caps. This program also takes an age (or any number entry) entered from its user, then determines whether the user is a minor or not depending on the age entry before displaying its determination.

## How does someone use this thing?
* Name feature: After running the program, it will ask the user (presumably, you) to enter a name. Once the name is typed in the text entry box, hit the keyboard's 'ENTER' key. 
* Age feature: After the program's done with the name, it will then ask the user to enter their age. Don't worry about putting anything like "years old" in there. We've got you covered! Once the age is typed in the text entry box, hit the keyboard's 'ENTER' key. 
* Ending/Closing the program: The program will automatically stop running after it's done doing its work. To close it completely, the user can close it as they would with any other program (or tab depending on how you're running it). If the user wants to use the program again, they need to start it back up in the same way as the first time.

## How does someone install this thing?
This program can be run inside of JupyterLab. To download/install or learn more about JupyterLab, go to their website here: https://jupyter.org/

## How am I able to use or distribute this thing?
